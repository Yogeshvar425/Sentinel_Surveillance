# BUILD.md — Engine Export & Inference Setup

This document covers the two build steps the Quick Start glosses over:

1. Exporting YOLOv8n to a **TensorRT `.engine`** for accelerated detection on Jetson.
2. Building **llama.cpp** for LFM2-VL on the Jetson Orin Nano Super — and the
   **unified-memory runtime flag** that is required for the model to load on this hardware.

> **Target hardware:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super (8 GB), JetPack 6.x, CUDA arch `sm_87`.

## Part 1 — YOLOv8n → TensorRT Engine

The Jetson ships with JetPack's own PyTorch/CUDA stack. Do **not** pip-install a
desktop PyTorch wheel — use the NVIDIA-provided Jetson wheels or the JetPack-bundled
build, otherwise CUDA will not initialise.

### 1.1 Install Ultralytics (Jetson-safe)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install ultralytics
# OpenCV is pre-installed by JetPack — do NOT pip-install opencv-python on Jetson
```

### 1.2 Export the engine
```bash
yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=engine half=True device=0 imgsz=640
```

| Flag           | Why                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format=engine`| Produces a serialized TensorRT `.engine`                      |
| `half=True`    | FP16 — ~2× throughput on Ampere, negligible accuracy loss     |
| `device=0`     | Build on the Jetson GPU (engines are **not** portable across devices/TensorRT versions) |
| `imgsz=640`    | Must match the inference resolution used in `surveillance4_1.py` |

This writes `yolov8n.engine`. Set `YOLO_MODEL` at the top of `surveillance4_1.py` to point at it (it is a constant in the script, not an `.env` variable).

> ⚠️ **Engines are not portable.** A `.engine` built on one TensorRT version / GPU
> will fail to load on another. Always rebuild on the deployment device. If you move
> to a new JetPack, re-export.

### 1.3 x86 / no-TensorRT fallback
On a desktop without TensorRT, skip the export and set `YOLO_MODEL = "yolov8n.pt"`
at the top of `surveillance4_1.py`, then switch `device=0` to `device='cpu'`
(or a CUDA index) in that file's `yolo.track(...)` call.

## Part 2 — Building llama.cpp for LFM2-VL on Jetson

This is the part that does **not** "just work." On the Orin Nano Super, llama.cpp
fails to load the model even though there is plenty of free memory — unless you
launch it with the unified-memory flag. This section documents the failure and the fix.

### 2.1 The problem
The Orin Nano Super uses **unified memory** — the CPU and GPU share one physical
RAM pool; there is no separate VRAM. Stock llama.cpp allocates GPU tensors with
`cudaMalloc` (dedicated-VRAM semantics). On this SoC that allocator path fails
even with several GB free:

```
NvMapMemAllocInternalTagged: 1075072515 error 12
ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_type_alloc_buffer: allocating 661.25 MiB on device 0:
    cudaMalloc failed: out of memory
alloc_tensor_range: failed to allocate CUDA0 buffer of size 693365760
llama_model_load: error loading model: unable to allocate CUDA0 buffer
common_init_from_params: failed to load model
```

`tegrastats` at this point shows the GPU **idle** and RAM mostly **free** —
confirming this is an allocator-semantics issue, not genuine memory exhaustion.

### 2.2 Prerequisites
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
Confirm CUDA is visible:
```bash
nvcc --version          # should report the JetPack CUDA toolkit
```

### 2.3 Clone
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

### 2.4 Build with the CUDA backend
A **normal CUDA build** is all you need — the unified-memory fix is applied at
*runtime* (§2.6), not at build time.

```bash
cmake -B build \
    -DGGML_CUDA=ON \
    -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87 \
    -DLLAMA_CURL=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)
```

| Flag                          | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GGML_CUDA=ON`                | Enable the CUDA backend                                        |
| `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87` | `sm_87` = Orin Ampere. Avoids building dead PTX for other GPUs |
| `LLAMA_CURL=ON`               | Lets `llama-server` fetch models via URL                       |

> **Note:** `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY` is a **runtime environment variable**
> read by GGML's CUDA backend — **not** a CMake option. There is nothing to build in;
> you set it when launching the server (§2.6). A stock CUDA build is correct.

### 2.5 Download the model
You need the **base GGUF** plus the **mmproj** (the vision projector — without it
the model is text-only and scene analysis will not work).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/models/lfm2-vl
cd ~/models/lfm2-vl
# from the LiquidAI LFM2-VL GGUF release on Hugging Face:
#   LFM2-VL-1.6B-Q4_0.gguf          (base quantised weights)
#   mmproj-LFM2-VL-1.6B-Q8_0.gguf   (vision projector)
```

### 2.6 Run the server — this is where the fix lives
Prepend **`GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1`** so GGML routes GPU allocations
through `cudaMallocManaged` (the shared pool) instead of `cudaMalloc`:

```bash
GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1 ~/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server \
    --model  ~/models/lfm2-vl/LFM2-VL-1.6B-Q4_0.gguf \
    --mmproj ~/models/lfm2-vl/mmproj-LFM2-VL-1.6B-Q8_0.gguf \
    --host 127.0.0.1 \
    --port 8080 \
    --n-gpu-layers 999 \
    --ctx-size 2048 \
    --parallel 1
```

- **`GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1`** — the fix. Without it, the load fails with
  the `cudaMalloc` error above; with it, the model loads fully on the GPU.
- `--host 127.0.0.1` — keep the VLM **local-only** (don't expose free inference to the LAN).
- `--n-gpu-layers 999` — offload all layers to the GPU.
- `--ctx-size 2048` / `--parallel 1` — small footprint, so it coexists with the
  detection engine on 8 GB of shared memory.

### 2.7 Verify
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health         # expect {"status":"ok"}
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models      # should list the loaded model
```
A `200 OK` from `/health` means SENTINEL's scene-analysis worker can reach the model.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                              | Cause / Fix                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cudaMalloc failed: out of memory`, GPU idle         | Missing the runtime flag — relaunch with `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` prepended |
| Model loads alone but OOMs alongside the engine      | Free the desktop GUI (`sudo systemctl stop display-manager`) and start **llama first**, then the engine — see `start_sentinel.sh` |
| Engine fails to load after a JetPack/TensorRT update | Re-export the `.engine` on the device — engines are version- and device-specific |
| Scene analysis returns empty / text-only             | `--mmproj` projector not passed or wrong file                               |
| `nvcc: command not found`                            | CUDA toolkit not on `PATH` — `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH`        |
| Model loads but is very slow                         | Layers running on CPU — confirm `--n-gpu-layers 999` and a CUDA-enabled build |

## Why this matters (the differentiator)

Most "run an LLM on Jetson" guides either use Ollama (which hides this problem) or
silently fall back to CPU. Running LFM2-VL **directly on the GPU via llama.cpp on a
shared-memory Orin SoC** requires the unified-memory allocation path — and that single
change, **setting `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` at launch**, takes the load from
*failing* to *fully GPU-accelerated* on 8 GB of shared RAM. That is the core deployment
contribution of this project.
